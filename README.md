## Hi thereðŸ‘‹
I am a smart and kind individual who is very interested in science. To go more into detail, I am mostly invested in areas of psychology, but also biology, chemistry, neuroscience, neurology, and biochemistry. I plan to pursue a career in one of these very interesting fields later in life. Currently though, I am learning how to code different AI models as well as learning more in depth about machine and deep learning.
